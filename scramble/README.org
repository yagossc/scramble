* Scramble API

  This is an API for checking that, given two separate words, base and
  target, the target word can be formed by a portion of base's
  letters.

** Project Dependencies

   For building and running the project you'll need:

   - Clojure (tested on: clojure "1.10.1")
   - Leiningen (tested on: Leiningen 2.9.6 on Java 1.8.0_292 OpenJDK
     64-Bit Server VM)

   And also, as clojure dependencies, you'll need:

   - compojure (1.6.2)
   - http-kit (2.5.3)
   - ring/ring-defaults (0.3.2)

** How to run

   Use leiningen:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > lein run
   #+END_SRC

   You can also use =Docker/Docker Compose= in case you don't have or
   wish to have all the dependecies in your local environment.

   First, build, create and start the container with the virtual
   environment by running:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > docker-compose up -d
   #+END_SRC

   This approach avoids having to reinstall the dependecies every time
   the container is created, especially because there isn't an obvious
   way of "pre-installing" the project dependencies using =leiningen=.

   Now, run the server:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > docker-compose exec -w '/scramble-api' scramble-env sh -c "lein run"
   #+END_SRC

** How to test

   Again, use leiningen:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > lein test
   #+END_SRC

   And, with =Docker=, remember to build the environment as stated
   above, then run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > docker-compose exec -w '/scramble-api' scramble-env sh -c "lein test"
   #+END_SRC

** API Routes

   The API has a single route:

   | Route    | Type | Params                                | Returns         |
   | scramble | GET  | base-string=[a-z]&target-string=[a-z] | true or  false  |


   Note: the API will return =404 Not Found= for everything else.

   You can use =curl= for sample requests:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > curl 'http://localhost:8080/scramble?base-string="abc"&target-string="abc"'
   Yep, that works.
   > curl 'http://localhost:8080/scramble?base-string="abc"&target-string="abcd"'
   Nope, sorry.
   #+END_SRC

   You can change the default value for the api and port in the file
   =src/scramble_frontend/config.cljs=, i.e.:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   ;; Defines the api port for sending the requests.
   (def api-port "DESIRED_PORT")
   #+END_SRC

   Or you can set the environment varialbe =SCRAMBLE_PORT=.
