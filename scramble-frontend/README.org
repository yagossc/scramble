* Scramble

  This a single page appication to talk to the =Scramble API= present
  in this project.

** Project Dependencies

   For building and running the project you'll need:

   - Clojure (tested on: clojure "1.10.1")
   - ClojureScript (tested on: clojure/clojurescript "1.10.773")
   - Leiningen (tested on: Leiningen 2.9.6 on Java 1.8.0_292 OpenJDK
     64-Bit Server VM)

   And also, as clojure dependencies, you'll need:

   - reagent (1.0.0)
   - re-frame (1.2.0)
   - day8.re-frame/http-fx

** How to build

   For building the web page, use leiningen:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > lein cljsbuild once dev
   #+END_SRC

   You can also have it automatically rebuild the page, in case of
   changes, by running:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   > lein cljsbuild auto dev
   #+END_SRC

** How to run

   Since there's no =HTTP Server= providing this frontend, please,
   open the file located at =resources/public/index.html= in your
   preferred browser.

   In case the =API= is not running in =localhost:8080=, please edit
   the file =src/scramble_frontend/config.cljs= and add the correct
   information, for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   ;; Defines the api port for sending the requests.
   (def api-port "CORRECT_PORT")

   ;; Defines the api host for sending the requests.
   (def api-host "API_LOCATION")
   #+END_SRC
